Expressions

The implementation of expressions is the same as the design in A4.
For binary expressions, the left operand is generated recursively, then the right 
operand is also generated recursively. The operator is then push onto the stack to 
evaluate those two operand. Unary expressions are also generated the same way, 
by generating the operand recursively and then pushing onto the stack the operator. 
Since we are given EQ, we implemented 'not' by comparing the boolean value to MACHINE FALSE 
to simulate NOT. Once we have NOT and since OR is given, then AND is implemented by using 
demorgans law. Conditional expressions are implemented similar to if statements.
