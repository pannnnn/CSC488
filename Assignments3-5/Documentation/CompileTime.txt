CompileTime

We did not use the CodeGen provided in the starter code to remain consistency with the design in A4, where we stated that we will use a class called CompileTime to trace all the information needed during compile time.

Since all AST nodes share one compile time, we made most of its variables and functions static. We have 3 public fields tracing compile time information.

- instructionCounter:
    Counting how many instructions are emitted.
- fillInIC:
    A list of addresses need to increment by the initPC.
- majorScopeCount:
    Counting how many major scopes are created.

Meanwhile we have 2 static functions:
- initMajorScope:
    Initialize a major scope. Label it as a major scope and set assign it with a new unique lexical level.
- finish:
    Finish the code generation process by computing and setting the values of PC, MSP and MLP.

Also we have a helper class Addr, wrapping the location of instructions and their value before initial program counter added. The address at memeory[location] will be later set to (value + initPC).
